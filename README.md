## üîÑ How It Works

### **System Overview**

The Amul Protein Products Notifier operates as a complete monitoring and notification system with three main components working together:

1. **Frontend (React.js)**: User interface for subscription management
2. **Backend (Node.js)**: API server handling business logic and email processing
3. **Scraper (Python)**: Automated web scraper monitoring Amul's website

### **Data Flow Process**

#### **1. User Subscription Flow**

```
User Input ‚Üí Frontend ‚Üí Backend API ‚Üí MongoDB Database
     ‚Üì
Email + City + Products ‚Üí Validation ‚Üí Storage ‚Üí Confirmation Email
```

#### **2. Product Monitoring Flow**

```
Amul Website ‚Üí Python Scraper ‚Üí Backend API ‚Üí Stock Change Detection
     ‚Üì
Product Data ‚Üí Comparison ‚Üí Queue ‚Üí Email Notifications
```

#### **3. Notification Flow**

```
Stock Change Detected ‚Üí Redis Queue ‚Üí Email Service ‚Üí User Inbox
     ‚Üì
Background Processing ‚Üí Retry Logic ‚Üí Delivery Confirmation
```

### **Technical Workflow**

#### **Subscription Management**

- **Email Validation**: Users enter email to check existing subscriptions
- **City Selection**: Dropdown with Delhi, Haryana, Karnataka, and Maharashtra options
- **Product Selection**: Categorized product list (Milkshakes, Paneer, Whey Protein, etc.)
- **Data Storage**: User preferences stored in MongoDB with unique tokens
- **Email Confirmation**: Welcome email with edit/unsubscribe links

#### **Automated Monitoring**

- **Web Scraping**: Python scraper monitors Amul's protein products page
- **Stock Detection**: Identifies products marked as "SOLD OUT" vs available
- **Change Detection**: Compares current stock status with previous data
- **Data Processing**: Sends stock changes to backend for processing
- **Uptime Robot Service**: External monitoring service calls the `/scrape` endpoint every 10 minutes to maintain continuous operation

### **Scraper Details**

#### **What the Scraper Does**

The Python scraper is the core monitoring component that:

- **Monitors Amul's Website**: Continuously checks the protein products page at `https://shop.amul.com/en/browse/protein`
- **Handles PIN Code Entry**: Automatically enters the configured PIN code (122003 for Haryana, 110036 for Delhi, 560001 for Karnataka, and 400001 for Maharashtra) to access location-specific product availability
- **Extracts Product Data**: Scrapes all protein products including:
  - Product names and IDs
  - Current stock status (Available/Sold Out)
  - Product categories and descriptions
  - Pricing information (when available)
- **Detects Stock Changes**: Compares current stock status with previously stored data to identify:
  - Products that were "Sold Out" but are now "Available"
  - Products that were "Available" but are now "Sold Out"
- **Sends Data to Backend**: Transmits scraped data to the Node.js backend for processing

#### **How the Scraper Works**

##### **1. Initialization Process**

```
Start Scraper ‚Üí Load Configuration ‚Üí Initialize Selenium WebDriver ‚Üí Navigate to Amul Website
```

##### **2. PIN Code Entry**

```
Locate PIN Input Field ‚Üí Enter Configured PIN Code ‚Üí Submit ‚Üí Wait for Page Load
```

##### **3. Product Scraping**

```
Parse HTML ‚Üí Extract Product Elements ‚Üí Identify Stock Status ‚Üí Store Product Data
```

##### **4. Data Processing**

```
Compare with Previous Data ‚Üí Identify Changes ‚Üí Filter Relevant Products ‚Üí Send to Backend
```

##### **5. Error Handling**

```
Network Issues ‚Üí Retry Logic ‚Üí Logging ‚Üí Alert System
```

#### **Technical Implementation**

- **Selenium WebDriver**: Uses Chrome/Chromium browser automation for dynamic content
- **BeautifulSoup**: HTML parsing for extracting product information
- **Multiple Selectors**: Implements various CSS selectors to handle website structure changes
- **Headless Mode**: Can run without browser UI for server deployment
- **Rate Limiting**: Respects website load by implementing delays between requests
- **Logging System**: Comprehensive logging for debugging and monitoring

#### **Scraping Strategy**

- **Robust Selectors**: Uses multiple CSS selectors to handle different page layouts
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: If primary selectors fail, tries alternative methods
- **Data Validation**: Validates scraped data before sending to backend
- **Incremental Updates**: Only processes products that have changed status
- **Error Recovery**: Automatically retries failed scraping attempts

#### **Monitoring Schedule**

- **Continuous Mode**: Runs indefinitely with configurable intervals (default: 60 seconds)
- **Single Run Mode**: Executes once for testing purposes
- **Configurable Timing**: Adjustable intervals based on requirements
- **Background Operation**: Designed to run as a background service
- **Uptime Robot Integration**: The `/scrape` endpoint is called every 10 minutes by Uptime Robot service to ensure continuous monitoring and prevent the scraper from going idle

#### **Email Notification System**

- **Queue Management**: Redis Bull Queue handles email processing
- **Background Jobs**: Asynchronous email sending to prevent blocking
- **Retry Logic**: Automatic retry for failed email deliveries
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents email spam and respects SMTP limits

#### **Subscription Management**

- **Token-based Links**: Secure edit and unsubscribe links in emails
- **Real-time Updates**: Users can modify products and city preferences
- **One-click Unsubscribe**: Immediate removal from notification list

### **Architecture Benefits**

- **Scalability**: Microservices architecture allows independent scaling
- **Reliability**: Queue system ensures no notifications are lost
- **User Experience**: Simple city selection instead of complex pincode validation
- **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns between components
- **Security**: Token-based authentication for subscription management
